# mirror

Mirror is a tool for mirroring your own mind back to you using AI.

Using the following tools and frameworks:

- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) 
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Groq](https://groq.com/)
- [Chroma](https://trychroma.com/)

It's a work in progress. Currently, it can index your Obsidian vault and answer questions about it using vector search.

See the [lang_programs.py](lang_programs.py) file for the current capabilities of the tool.

See the [vector_store.py](vector_store.py) file for the current capabilities of the tool.
